indentation
===========

This highlights the file input to it.
You need to input the file to it throught the terminal itself. For example ./a.out [filename]
else an error will be output.
The input is a file that is not indentated whereas the output will be the indentated contents.
The basic requirements like that of checking bracket formedness is not the job of this code as with even the correct syntax.
All this code will do is give you the correct indentated output based on the bracket comparison.
